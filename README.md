# Loan-Eligibility-Predictor
This project implements a machine learning-based Loan Eligibility Predictor. It uses a dataset of loan applicants to train various classification models and predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied.
Key features:
Comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis
Implementation of multiple classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes
Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
Decision Tree, Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (Linear, Gaussian, and Polynomial kernels)
Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like accuracy, TPR, and TNR
Web application deployment using Flask
The best-performing model (SVM with linear kernel) is deployed as a user-friendly web application. Users can input applicant details such as gender, marital status, income, credit history, and more. The application then predicts loan eligibility based on these inputs.
This project demonstrates proficiency in machine learning, data analysis, and web application development, showcasing an end-to-end data science workflow.
